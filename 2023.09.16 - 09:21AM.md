Ah, I love the fresh small of a new try of a new project in the morning. I once written somewhere something like: "I'm a serial project starter", meaning that I have a lot of ideas for a lot of projects a lot of time.

Nothing too special, I know, but what bothers me the most is my impossibility to take them to reality, or to stop thinking about them, or to not achieving them, or start them and abandon them, etc.

The thing is, I'm sure they are really good projects, so these fails are frustrating. Furthermore, there are some projects that I think that may be found useful by people or even help them. We'll see later how.

My usual problem is that I'm not good at parallelizing so, I'm trying to think about solutions for that.

I decided to take this approach: I'll use Git as a kind of Project Tracker.

I'm not thinking about this much but let's see where it goes.

For now, I have created these repositories:

- [blog](https://github.com/marcelomazza/blog): current repository, used for blogging
- [bio](https://github.com/marcelomazza/bio): a kind of blog/diary/reflection on my life, constantly evolving
- [manifiesto](https://github.com/marcelomazza/manifiesto): personal manifest
- [metodo](https://github.com/marcelomazza/metodo): trying to define a Personal Development Method (PDM)

I'll create new repositories as new ideas arrive.

For now, these are just dump of text of ideas that were already rounding round my head. Let's prove how writing about them acts on them and their reality.
